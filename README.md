# cka-material
This repo contains information for CKA exams. It has vagrant files and tests that can be used for practice. It takes inspiration on other repositories and tries to provide real 'practice-like' sessions with the use of custom vagrant boxes.

It provides no answers, but feel free to open a PR and we'll review it for you.

Sessions are taken weekly, and that's about the time this repo shall be updated.
